            <h2>Virat Kohli resigns his captaincy from Test Match Cricket!</h2>
            <img src="images/kohli.jpg" alt="Virat it is!" />
            <p>
                Kohli had stepped down from the Test captaincy role earlier last week
                a day after the Test series ended in Cape Town, marking an end of an
                era in Indian cricket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah opened up about Virat Kohli's decision to
                step down from Test captaincy after India's 2-1 Test series defeat
                against South Africa last week. Revealing that Kohli had talked to the
                team members regarding his decision to step down from the role, Bumrah
                remained tight-lipped on the proceedings, calling it a personal
                decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kohli had stepped down from the Test captaincy role earlier last week
                a day after the Test series ended in Cape Town, marking an end of an
                era in Indian cricket. Kohli had earlier relinquished his T20I
                captaincy role in November and a month later was removed from ODI
                captaincy position with the selectors naming Rohit Sharma the new
                white-ball captain.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Virat Kohli told us about leaving his Test captaincy in a team
                meeting. It’s his decision. He knows his body. He knows his frame of
                mind. We respect that. It’s been a pleasure to play under his
                captaincy. I made my debut under him”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He brought in energy. He brought in the fitness culture. He was
                driven. Everybody moved in one direction under his leadership. He has
                been immense and he will still be the immense with his inputs,” said
                Bumrah ahead of the start of the three-match ODI series in Paarl
                against South Africa.

                India-South Africa Test series involved emotion, Ashes lacked it: Ian
                Chappell
            </h2>

                Former Australia captain Ian Chappell believes the recently-concluded
                Test series between South Africa and India showed ample emotion which
                has been missing from the Ashes. He added that there was some
                exquisite batting on display in the Test series between South Africa
                and India despite the conditions being overwhelmingly in favour of the
                bowling side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some nine hours away South Africa surprisingly defeated India in an
                old-fashioned dogfight that included some enthralling cricket. It also
                involved ample emotion of the sort that has notably been missing from
                an Ashes contest that has been surprisingly uncontroversial so far,"
                wrote Chappell in his column for ESPNCricinfo on Sunday.
            </p>
            <p>
                South Africa came back from 1-0 down to win the three-match series 2-1
                at Cape Town on Friday. Talking further about the batting in
                particular during the series, Chappell remarked, “The South Africa
                series featured bowling domination on pitches that were probably too
                much in favour of the fielding side, but there was also some exquisite
                batting."
